# Fix Dashboard Title Typo

## Summary
Rename "Semles Dashboard Admin" to "Dashboard Admin" in translation files to correct a typo/placeholder.

## Background
The user noticed the text "Semles" in the dashboard header and was confused. It appears to be a typo for "Seamless" or a leftover placeholder.

## Goals
1. Change the dashboard title to be clear and professional.

## Plan
1. Update `frontend/src/locales/id.json` and `frontend/src/locales/en.json`.
