# Improve Mobile UX

## Why
The current mobile experience is cluttered. The header elements (language, theme) take up too much space, and the dashboard title/content doesn't scale well, causing layout issues.

## What Changes
1.  **Mobile Header**: Move Language and Theme toggles into the Profile Dropdown menu on mobile devices. Keep them visible in the header on desktop.
2.  **Dashboard Responsive**: Adjust font sizes and spacing on the Dashboard to fit smaller screens better.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> On mobile, you will need to tap your profile picture to change the language or theme.
