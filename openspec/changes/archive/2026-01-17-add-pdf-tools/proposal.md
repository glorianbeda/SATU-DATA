# Proposal: Add PDF Tools Suite

## Why
Users frequently need to manipulate PDF documents (compress, split, edit pages, convert). Integrating these tools directly into the application improves productivity and keeps data local/secure without relying on external services.

## What Changes
We will add a new "PDF Editor" (PDF Tools) section under the "Alat" (Tools) menu with four sub-features:
1.  **PDF Compress**: Reduce file size (client-side lossy optimization).
2.  **PDF Editor**: Organize pages (Rotate, Delete, Reorder).
3.  **PDF Splitter**: Extract pages into separate files.
4.  **PDF Converter**: Convert PDF to Images and Images to PDF.
