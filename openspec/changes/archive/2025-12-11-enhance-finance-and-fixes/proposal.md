# Enhance Finance and UI Fixes

## Why
Users need a way to bulk import financial data from Excel to save time. Additionally, there are UI bugs in the sidebar on mobile and the profile page is not loading user data correctly, which degrades the user experience.

## What Changes
1.  **Finance Import**: Add Excel/CSV import functionality for Income and Expense pages with column validation.
2.  **Sidebar Fix**: Fix the sidebar height issue on mobile devices.
3.  **Profile Fix**: Fix the data loading issue on the Profile page by aligning authentication methods.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The import feature requires specific column names in the Excel file. We will provide a template or strict validation instructions.
