# Change: Add OpenSpec Workflow

## Why
To standardize the development process, improve documentation, and ensure that all changes are spec-driven. This will help in maintaining the "Satu Data+" project's quality and consistency as it grows.

## What Changes
- Populate `openspec/project.md` with project context.
- Establish a new capability: `project-management` to track development workflows.
- Define the initial requirement for Spec-Driven Development.

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: `project-management` (New Capability)
- **Affected code**: None (Documentation/Process only)
