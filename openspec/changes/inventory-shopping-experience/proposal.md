# Inventory Shopping Experience

## Goal
Transform the asset borrowing process into an intuitive "shopping-like" experience for members, while adding a verification layer for asset returns involving photographic proof.

## Background
Currently, users request assets one by one or via a basic list. The stakeholder wants a familiar e-commerce style flow: select items -> set duration -> checkout. Additionally, the return process is currently manual; a new requirement enforces uploading a "proof of return" photo which administrators must verify before closing the loan.

## Key Changes
1.  **Shopping Interface:** A card-based asset catalog with "Add to Cart" functionality.
2.  **Checkout Flow:** Batch request submission with a unified due date.
3.  **Return Verification:** Users upload a photo when returning; Admins verify this photo to complete the return.
4.  **Visual Timeline:** A "snake-like" (S-shape) visual indicator for the loan lifecycle on dashboards and detail pages.

## User Impact
- **Members:** Easier requesting process, clear tracking of loan status, digital confirmation of return.
- **Admins:** Streamlined validation of returned assets via photo proof.
