# Enhance Finance Modal UI

## Summary
Redesign the Transaction Modal to be more visually appealing, modern, and user-friendly, aligning with the "premium" design aesthetic of the application.

## Motivation
The user explicitly requested to make the modal UI "attractive" (menarik) after seeing the initial basic implementation. The current design is too standard and lacks visual hierarchy and polish.

## Impact
-   **Frontend**: `TransactionModal.jsx` will be significantly refactored with better styling, icons, and layout.
-   **Quick Edit**: Enhance `/quick-edit` to resemble a spreadsheet interface more closely (compact grid, better inputs).
-   **UX**: Improved user experience for adding transactions with clearer visual cues and a more pleasant interface.
